Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. This is important for a PERFECT response â€” 14 Jun 2025, â€ŠEurope/London-time.  
Hereâ€™s the plan I suggest:

---

### 1 â€” Clarify the input you can give me  
To extract dates & times Iâ€™ll need the raw Discord export (or a simple copy-paste) that **includes** the grey timestamp you see on the right of each message, e.g.

```
13 June 2025 08:49  |   Model Finder: @Legit ðŸ˜“
:icons_delete: Gemini Models
gemini-1.5-flash-001
These models were removed just now!
```

or whatever export format you have.  
*Could you share a snippet in that shape (ideally a few messages covering at least two different days) or confirm the exact structure?*  
Once I see it, Iâ€™ll write code that:

* finds every message boundary  
* pulls out the timestamp, converts date â†’ `YYYY_MM_DD`, time â†’ `HH:MM:SS`  
* detects **source**, **model_name(s)**, **status** and **comments** exactly as you specified  
* stops once it reaches `2025-06-01 00:00:00`  
* writes the rows to `models.csv` in the required order:

```
model_name,source,date,time,status,comments
```

### 2 â€” Script outline (ready to flesh out)  

```python
import re, csv, datetime, pathlib

MSG_SPLIT = re.compile(r'^\d{1,2}\s+\w+\s+\d{4}\s+\d\d:\d\d', re.M)
SRC_PAT   = re.compile(r':icons_[^:]+:\s*(.+)')
MODEL_PAT = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9].*')  # simplified; refined once we see real data

def parse_message(block: str):
    # 1. timestamp
    ts_match = re.match(r'^(\d{1,2}\s+\w+\s+\d{4})\s+(\d\d:\d\d)', block)
    ...
```

(The full code will live in a single cell Iâ€™ll run for you, show the resulting table, and hand back a downloadable `models.csv`.)

### 3 â€” Next steps  

1. Send me 4-5 raw messages (with their timestamps) so I can confirm the parsing rules.  
2. Iâ€™ll drop in the finished Python, run it live, and youâ€™ll get both the preview **and** the CSV file to download.

Sound good?
